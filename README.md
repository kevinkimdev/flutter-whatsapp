Whatsapp (ver. 2.19.98) clone using Flutter.

## About

I made this for my study/exercise on Flutter. I only make the client-side app, the server side is a dummy server.

It's still work in progress. Check out Trello below for more info.

## Development

**Note**: Create your own Firebase project and add the `google-services.json` to the project to use QR code reader.
